"""Skill manifest / tag extraction shared by nested agent tools.

Open WebUI's skill subsystem injects two different shapes into the
parent conversation's system messages depending on how a skill was
selected:

- **Available skills** are listed in a single ``<available_skills>``
  manifest block; their content is loaded lazily by ``view_skill``.
  Core v0.11.4 can include accessible workspace and terminal skills,
  in addition to model-attached skills.
- **Inline skills** use full ``<skill name="...">...</skill>`` blocks;
  ``view_skill`` is unnecessary for their already-expanded content.
  Older Core versions inline user-selected skills. Core v0.11.4 inlines
  mentioned skills, or selected skills when builtin tools are unavailable.

The plugins that spawn agent loops
need to read both shapes out of ``__messages__`` so the spawned agent
inherits the parent's skill context. They also need to register
``view_skill`` manually in their own ``tools_dict`` because their
agent loop bypasses the core middleware that would normally bind
builtin tools.

Lives in its own shared dep (rather than ``shared.tool_servers`` or a
larger generic module) so plugins that don't use skills don't include
this code in their bundle; the inliner has no tree-shaking. It follows
the same shared-dep "no mixing external + cross-shared imports" rule
that already shaped ``shared.tool_execution`` / ``shared.mcp_tools``:
the tiny ``maybe_await`` helper is inlined privately rather than
imported from ``shared.async_utils``.
