"""Inlet-filter application helper shared by tool plugins.

Open WebUI normally runs inlet filter functions before forwarding a
request to the model. Plugins that issue their own ``generate_chat_completion``
calls miss that pipeline, so they re-run the inlet filter chain manually
when their ``APPLY_INLET_FILTERS`` Valve is on.

``process_filter_functions`` re-injects the matched filter's
``UserValves`` into the ``__user__`` dict it receives, which means a
shared ``__user__`` object would leak filter-specific valves into the
caller's subsequent tool calls under a different tool id. The helper
guards against that by shallow-copying ``extra_params`` and the inner
``__user__`` dict before handing them to core.

The helper inlines a private ``_inlet_filters_maybe_await`` instead of importing
``maybe_await`` from ``shared.async_utils`` because the inliner forbids
a shared dep module from mixing external imports (``fastapi.Request``)
with imports from other ``owui_ext.shared.*`` modules.
